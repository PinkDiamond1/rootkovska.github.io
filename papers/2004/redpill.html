    color=red>Red Pill...</font> or how to detect VMM using (almost) one CPU
   instruction</h4>

  <h3 align=center><a href="mailto:joanna@invisiblethings.org">Joanna Rutkowska</a></h3>

  <p>Swallowing the <font color=red>Red Pill</font> is more or less equivalent
  to the following code (returns non zero when in Matrix):</p>

  <pre>
     int swallow_redpill () {
       unsigned char m[2+4], rpill[] = "\x0f\x01\x0d\x00\x00\x00\x00\xc3";
       *((unsigned*)&rpill[3]) = (unsigned)m;
       ((void(*)())&rpill)();
       return (m[5]>0xd0) ? 1 : 0;
     }
  </pre>

  <p>The heart of this code is actually the SIDT instruction (encoded as
  <code>0F010D[addr]</code>), which stores the contents of the interrupt
  descriptor table register (IDTR) in the destination operand, which is
  actually a memory location.  What is special and interesting about SIDT
  instruction is that, it can be executed in non privileged mode (ring3) but it
  returns the contents of the sensitive register, used internally by operating
  system.</p>
  
  <p>Because there is only one IDTR register, but there are at least two OS
  running concurrently (i.e. the host and the guest OS), VMM needs to relocate
  the guest's IDTR in a safe place, so that it will not conflict with a host's
  one. Unfortunately, VMM cannot know if (and when) the process running in
  guest OS executes SIDT instruction, since it is not privileged (and it
  doesn't generate exception).  Thus the process gets the relocated address of
  IDT table. It was observed that on VMWare, the relocated address of IDT is at
  address <code>0xff<i>XXXXXX</i></code>, whereas on Virtual PC it is
  <code>0xe8<i>XXXXXX</i></code>. This was tested on VMWare Workstation 4 and
  Virtual PC 2004, both running on Windows XP host OS.</p>

  <p>BTW, I would be more then happy if anyone test it on different VMMs,
  running on different host OSes and send me the results. I could then create a
  table of known addresses of IDTR, which could potentially be used to not only
  detect the VMM presence but also its version and the host OS...  </p>

  <p>I came across this strange behavior of SIDT instruction a few years ago,
  when I was testing <a href="http://phrack.org/show.php?p=58&a=7">Suckit
   rootkit</a> on VMWare. I noticed that it failed to load on VMWare whereas it
  seemed to work fine on the same distribution ran outside VM. After
  spending many hours I figured out that the problematic instruction was
  actually SIDT, which was used by Suckit to get the address of the IDT table,
  and to hook its 0x80 entry through <code>/dev/kmem</code> device.</p>

  <p>However, I was not the first one who discovered this trick. Shortly after
  my adventure with Suckit I found a very good <a
   href="http://www.cs.nps.navy.mil/people/faculty/irvine/publications/2000/VMM-usenix00-0611.pdf">USENIX
   paper</a> about problems when implementing Virtual Machines on Intel processors,
  discussing of course SIDT problem, as well as many others. This paper is
  really worth reading!</p>

  <p>So now, here is the simple code, written in C, which should compile on
  any all Intel based OS. Just in case you don't have the C compiler for Windows,
  there is also a binary version attached.</p>
  <p>
  <a href=http://invisiblethings.org/tools/redpill.c><code>redpill.c</code></a><br>
  <a href=http://invisiblethings.org/tools/redpill.exe><code>redpill.exe</code></a>
  </p>

  <a name=note></a> <p>NOTE: this program will fail on systems with
  PAX/X^W/grsecurity, protection (as it was pointed out by Brad Spengler) since
  the <code>rpill</code> variable is not marked as executable. To make it run in such
  systems, <code>mprotect()</code> should be used to mark <code>rpill</code>
  with <code>PROT_EXEC</code> attribute. Another solution would be to just use
  <code>asm()</code> keyword instead of shellcode-like buffer. However, this
  program should be rather considered as a skeleton to build into your own
  shellcode, rather then standalone production class tool;) My goal was to make
  it as simple and portable as possible.  That's why I didn't use
  <code>asm()</code> nor <code>mprotect()</code> since they are system or compiler
  dependent. </p>
   
  <p>I am also aware of another implementation of this technique, as well as
  some other tricks to fingerprint VMWare, which can be found at <a
   href="http://www.trapkit.de/">http://www.trapkit.de/</a>.</p>
